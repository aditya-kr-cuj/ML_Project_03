# **House Price Prediction Project**

This project is part of my internship's third task, where I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on several features such as house size, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

---

## **Features**
- **Prediction Model**: Trained using Linear Regression.
- **Dataset**: Real-world housing dataset with features like:
  - Size of the house (sqft)
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Location
  - Other features relevant to housing prices.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes normalization and encoding categorical variables.
- **User-Friendly Script**: Accepts new input data for prediction and outputs the predicted price.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation
  - `joblib` for saving and loading the model

---
## **Results**
The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): value
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): value
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): value

## **Folder Structure**
- Housing.csv: Dataset containing house features and prices.
- house_price_prediction.py: Script for training the model, preprocessing the data, and saving the trained model.
- User_predicting_model.py: Script for using the trained model to predict house prices based on user-provided data.
